  "description": "                    This project includes a simple Cocoa control that can be used as an alternative for the standard UISegmentedControl provided by UIKit.\n\n                    The control is made by a simple UIScrollView that can be scrolled horizontally to select amongst a set of NSString values.\n\n                    The advantage over a traditional UISegmentedControl is that with MVSelectorScrollView it's easy to select up to a dozen of values.\n",
