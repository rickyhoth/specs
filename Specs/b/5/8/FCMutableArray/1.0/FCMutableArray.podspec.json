  "description": "FCMutableArray is a composite class that behaves in the same way than an NSMutableArray, adding a delegate to it. The delegate is informed each time an object is added or removed from the array, and is also asked the permission to do so. That makes FCMutableArray a very good candidate to manage object queues.",
