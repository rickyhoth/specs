  "description": "Our story began after seeing how manufacturers relied on customers losing track of their warranties to save money. So we created a way for consumers to track their purchases so they wouldn’t have to worry about that ever again. That feature is still available today.\n\nOver time, we also saw how the mobile device market was growing. The pain points people went through when their smart device got broken and how difficult it was to find affordable protection. We saw consumers overpaying for coverage that often isn’t needed and in the long run, didn’t make sense.\n\nSo we decided we wanted to give people a better choice.\n\nWe removed the overpriced extras, along with the commissions and margins usually paid to the carriers so you can keep more money in your pocket.\n\nOur valued customers get the same benefits, but pay much less, with the best customer service.\n\nWe believe everyone deserves to have their smartphone, iPad, tablet, and smartwatch protected from accidents and mechanical malfunctions at a fair price.\n\nWarranty Life has become a leader in this industry and have provided protection plan products since 2009 with a 4.5-star customer trust rating. We...are here to serve.\n\nOh yes, did we mention we cover any device, new and used?\n\nWe are happy you’ve gotten this far, now let’s get you protected!",
