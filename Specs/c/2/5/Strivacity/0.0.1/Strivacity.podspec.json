  "summary": "The Strivacity iOS SDK allows you to integrate Strivacity's sign-in journeys into your brand's iOS application.",
  "description": "This SDK allows your iOS app to implement the following Strivacity identity workflows:\n• Login\n• Registration\n• Multi-factor authentication\n• Identity verification\n• Password resets\n• Username reminders\n• Biometric authentication using FaceID and Touch ID\n\nAll of these are implemented using standard OpenID Connect protocols, implemented via web views inside your iOS application. After initial authentication through a web view, you can implement storage of the authentication state in Keychain to allow the use of FaceID and TouchID for local authentication.",
