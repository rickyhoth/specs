  "description": "Sidewalk Mobile SDK provides a one-stop shop for everything related to Sidewalk on mobiles. It has its own Bluetooth and network stack, and is able to communicate to both the edge device (over BLE) and the Sidewalk cloud. Currently, the Sidewalk Mobile SDK exports the underlying Alexa Mobile Accessory (AMA) BLE stack, and allows applications to scan for AMA beaconing devices and then provision these devices over AMA to use the Sidewalk network. It handles the interaction between the Sidewalk cloud and edge device, exchanging keys and registering the edge device, so that the edge device can connect to the Sidewalk network via Sidewalk gateways. Authentication is provided via integration with Login with Amazon (LWA).\n\nSidewalk Mobile SDK is designed to assist developers in integrating common Sidewalk user controls into developersâ€™ own mobile applications for controls such as the endpoint registration and de-registration. Sidewalk Mobile SDK is able to communicate to both the endpoint (over BLE) and the Sidewalk cloud.\n\nSidewalk Mobile SDK applications are required to integrate with Login with Amazon (LWA) SDK to collect a user Auth Token for issuing Sidewalk controls. The iOS Mobile SDK also requires OpenSSL.",
