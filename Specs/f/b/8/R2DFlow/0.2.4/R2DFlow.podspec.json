  "summary": "A conceptual 'made for Swift and SwiftUI' framework as an alternative to Redux/ReSwift's unidirectional data flow.",
  "description": "The app follows a similar concept of unidirectional data flow as does Redux/ReSwift.\nHowever there is no store, and there are two different kind of actions. Workflow Actions that either trigger a Workflow (Similar to Middleware with side effects) and Reducer Actions, which trigger a reducer that then changes the state with pure functions.\nAnd a short-circuit that allows @Bindings to directly change the state.",
