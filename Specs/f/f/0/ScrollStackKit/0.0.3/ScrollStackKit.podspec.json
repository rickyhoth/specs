  "description": "Scroll Stack Kit is based on UIKit and provides a scrollable stack view, called ScrollStackView.\n\nScrollStackView is a view that allows you to create vertical scrollable layouts in an easy way, using a combination of UIScrollView and UIStackView. Acquiring all the benefits of these two components it uses autolayout to position and size all the rows within itself.\n\nScrollStackView finds a perfect use when you need to manage a list of heterogeneous elements in a scrollable layout, it allows you to avoid the tedious management of recycling views separating the logic of each element.",
