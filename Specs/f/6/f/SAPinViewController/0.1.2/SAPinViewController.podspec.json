This simple library allows you to draw a fully customisable PIN screen same as the iOS default PIN view.\nMy inspiration to create this library was form [THPinViewController](https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/THPinViewController), however ```SAPinViewController``` is completely implemented in ```Swift```. Also the main purpose of creating this library was to have simple, easy to use and fully customisable PIN screen.",
