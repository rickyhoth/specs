  "description": "A DroppableView represents a single draggable View. Use it as a base class for any view that should be draggable. You can even use it to drag something out of a scrollview, as you can see in the example project. You can define views as drop targets. You will then be informed, if a dragged view hits those targets, leaves them again or is released / dropped over a drop target.",
