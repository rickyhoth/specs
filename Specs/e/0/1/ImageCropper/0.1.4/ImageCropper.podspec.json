  "description": "Module for implementing the process of cropping images\n\nIn the process of creating a variety of projects, developers often face the need to crop images (whether the user's avatar on the social network, background images, and so on).\n\nOf course, iOS provides its own tools for image processing using the \"Photos\" application, but its use is not always convenient, justified, or even possible.\n\nThis library provides the ability to cut out sections of the original image in specified proportions by user's gesture interactions.\n\nThis solution presents itself a module developed on the basis of MVP + Clean Architecture (https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/ios-mvp-clean-architecture/) by code generator Generatus (https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/Generatus)",
