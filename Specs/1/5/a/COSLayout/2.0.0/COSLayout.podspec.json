  "description": "COSLayout is yet another layout library. It's neither a wrapper nor a replacement for Auto Layout. It dose not handle circular references of constraints and constraint priority. Besides that, COSLayout can solve all layout cases. What's more, COSLayout provides some additional benefits: smaller memory footprint, better performance and more intuitive expression.",
