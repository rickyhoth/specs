  "description": "                    _.m is a port of [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) to Objective-C. It strives to provide the fullest feature set possible in a way that is familiar to JavaScript developers (despite the differences between JavaScript and Objective-C).\n\n                    To help achieve this vision, _.m uses [SubjectiveScript.m](https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/SubjectiveScript.m) to bring JavaScript-like syntax and features into Objective-C, and [QUnit.m](https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/QUnit.m) to port unit tests from JavaScript to Objective-C. You should check them out, too!\n\n                    Full documentation can be found on the [_.m Website](http://kmalakoff.github.com/_.m/)\n",
