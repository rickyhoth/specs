  "summary": "A UITabBarController replacement with support for floating action button and adaptivity between trait environments on iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "The AdaptiveTabBarController is an adaptive view controller that can be installed as \nthe root view controller of your application. It provides a floating action button which\ncan have actions presented when tapped. It uses the built in UITabBarController while in\na compact trait environment, and a custom built vertical tab bar controller while in a\nregular trait environment. The controller automatically adapts between the two as the\ntrait environment changes (e.g. split screen adjustments on iPad)",
