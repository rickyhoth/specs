  "description": "ATMHud offers a versatile and full featured HUD for yuour iOS projects. You can use either a traditional protocol based delegate or a block based one. A Demo app shows how to use most of the feature set and both delegates. You can set any of a caption, two types of progress indicators, and an image to the HUD, which resizes as needed. You can control where the progress indicator goes (top/bot/left/right), the view grayness and cover view's grayness/opacity. If you're showing the HUD with the keyboard up (for example), you can move the HUD's center.\n\nUsage:\n    // Keep a strong ivar reference to it (ie, \"ATMHud *hud\")\n\thud = [ATMHud new]; // using the block delegate\n\t[hud setCaption:@\"Caption and an activity indicator.\"];\n\t[hud setActivity:YES];\n\thud.blockDelegate = ....; // see demo project\n\t[hud showInView:self.view];\n\t...\n\t[hud hide];\n\t//the block delegate can release the hud and nil the ivar (see Demo app)\n\n",
