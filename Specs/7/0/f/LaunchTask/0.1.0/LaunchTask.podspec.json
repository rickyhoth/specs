  "description": "This is a lib for managing App launch tasks.\nA large App often needs to perform a large number of tasks during the launch phase. \nIf there are many app developers, it is easy to cause the code of AppDelegate to be modified frequently and become more and more bloated. \nIt is also easy to cause the launch time of the App to be longer, and it will eventually be killed by Watchdog.\nThis lib encapsulates the launch code into subclasses of each Task, and configures the execution order and dependencies of Tasks through Workflow. At the same time, by blocking the didFinishLaunch method, tasks are executed concurrently to speed up the launch time.",
