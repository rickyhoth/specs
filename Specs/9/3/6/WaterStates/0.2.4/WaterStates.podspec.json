Now you can easily and simply call up the necessary states for display, WaterStates will do the rest.\n\nInside, a StateMachine is used that determines the delay and decides when to show, hide, or skip the state display.\n\nInstructions for installation are in [the README](https://bitbucket.devops.nonprod.empf.local/scm/react/WaterStates).",
