  "description": "The `OSPaymentsPluginLib-iOS` is a library build using `Swift` that lets you set a payment experience using Apple Pay. It allows to set the payment's details, such as the merchantâ€™s information, payment amount and currency, as well as shipping and billing address. This information can then used to process a payment within an app.\n\nThe `OSPMTActionDelegate` protocol, along with the class that implements it - `OSPMTPayments` - allows this interaction, providing the following operations:\n- Setup Payment Configuration\n- Check if Device is Ready for Payment\n- Set Details and Trigger Payment",
